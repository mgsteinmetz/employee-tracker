## Description
This is an employee tracker! The user is able to add, and keep track of their employees using this application!

## Installation
To install, travel to my github, and use my code! 

## Usage 
To USE my code, all you have to do is type 'node employee.js' into the integrated terminal!! It will then prompt you with questions and information.

This application will work by wither typing 'node employee.js' OR 'npm start' if you have the start script installed in you package.json file!!

In this example photo I used 'npm start' (what I normally use)!

After the application runs it will show the available prompts for the user to interact with!
